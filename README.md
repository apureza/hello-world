Intro to Github test repository

Hello,

My name is Aren. I am a computer science student attending DePaul University's College of Computing and Digital Media. I am currently learning about how to use the basic functions of GitHub, and I intend to learn about and use Git next. I am mainly writing code in Java currently, but I want to learn JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and I suppose a lot more things because I want to be a full stack developer.
